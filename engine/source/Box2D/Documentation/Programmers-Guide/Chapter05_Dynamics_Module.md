## Overview

The Dynamics module is the most complex part of LiquidFun and is the part you
likely interact with the most. The Dynamics module sits on top of the Common
and Collision modules, so you should be somewhat familiar with those by now.

The Dynamics module contains:

* fixture class

* rigid body class

* contact class

* joint classes

* world class

* listener classes

There are many dependencies between these classes so it is difficult to
describe one class without referring to another. In the following, you may see
some references to classes that have not been described yet. Therefore, you
may want to quickly skim this chapter before reading it closely.

The dynamics module is covered in the following chapters.
