# Building for Android

### Version Requirements

Following are the minimum required versions for the tools and libraries you
need for building LiquidFun for Android:

-   Android SDK:  Android 2.3.3 (API Level 10)
-   ADT: 20130917
-   NDK: android-ndk-r9
-   NDK plugn for Eclipse: bundled with ADT
-   cmake (when building from source): 2.8.12.1

### Before Building

-   Install the [Android SDK].
-   Install the [Android NDK].

### Building

Each LiquidFun project for Android has an associated `AndroidManifest.xml`
file and `jni` subdirectory.  For samples, `AndroidManifest.xml` contains
details about how to build an Android package (apk).  For libraries, such as
LiquidFun and freeglut, the `AndroidManifest.xml` file informs the `ndk-build`
tool that the directory contains NDK makefiles under the `jni` subdirectory.

The following [Android NDK][] projects live in the liquidfun directory tree.

-   `liquidfun/Box2D` - liquidfun dynamic and static libraries.
-   `liquidfun/Box2D/HelloWorld` - Non-interactive Hello World sample
     application.
-   `liquidfun/Box2D/Testbed` - Interactive Testbed sample application.

To build an [Android NDK][] project:

-   Open a command line window.
-   Go to the working directory containing the project to build.
-   Execute ndk-build.

For example, to build the LiquidFun dynamic and static libraries:

    cd liquidfun/Box2D
    ndk-build

### Executing a Sample

Running a sample requires the Android Development Tools ([ADT][]) plugin and
the [NDK Eclipse plugin][].

#### Running an application using Eclipse:

-   Build a project using `ndk-build` (see above).
-   Open [ADT][] Eclipse.
-   Select "File->Import..." from the menu.
-   Select "Android > Existing Android Code Into Workspace", and click "Next".
-   Click the "Browse..." button next to `Root Directory:` and select the
    project folder (e.g. `liquidfun/Box2D/Testbed`).
-   Click "Finish". Eclipse imports the project, and displays it in the
    Package Explorer pane.
-   Right-click the project, and select "Run->Run As->Android Application"
    from the menu.
-   If you do not have a physical device, you must define a virtual one.
    For details about how to define a virtual device, see [managing avds][].
    We donâ€™t recommend a virtual device for development.

-   If the target is a physical device, unlock the device and observe the application executing.

#### Build and Run from the Command Line:

It's also possible to use `build_apk.sh` to build, deploy, and execute an application.
`build_apk.sh` requires the installation of the [Android NDK][] and [Android SDK][].
On Windows the script requires that you install [Cygwin][], as it
makes use of Bash and common UNIX utilities.  In addition, `build_apk.sh`
requires the addition of the [Android SDK][] `sdk/tools`, [Android SDK][]
`sdk/platform-tools` and [Android NDK][] root directories to the `PATH`
environment variable.

To build and run an application using `build_apk.sh`:

-   Change into the directory containing the project to build.
-   Run build\_apk.sh.

For example, the following will build the Testbed application, deploy it to
the connected device, and start it:

    cd liquidfun/Box2D/Testbed
    ../AndroidUtil/build_apk.sh

### Code Generation

By default, code is generated for devices that support the `armeabi-v7a` ABI.
Alternatively, you can generate a fat `.apk` that includes code for all ABIs.
To do so, override APP\_ABI on ndk-build's command line:

    ndk-build APP_ABI=all

### Running Unit Tests

Developers modifying the LiquidFun library can verify that it is still working
correctly by executing the provided unit tests.

Use the run\_tests\_android.sh script to execute unit tests:

    ./liquidfun/Box2D/Unittests/run_tests_android.sh

`run_tests_android.sh` uses `build_apk.sh` to build, deploy, and
execute each unit test on the connected device.
The "Build and Run from the Command Line" section above describes
the setup requirements for `build_apk.sh`.
